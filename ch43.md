# Ch.43 Inter-Process Communication

## 43.1 Taxonomy of IPC

![Figure 43-1: A taxonomy of UNIX IPC facilities](asset/image/fig43-1.png)

Porting
Similar facilities were developed on an UNIX system and later ported to different UNIX variants

Similar facilities across different UNIX variants
- System V IPC facilities, POSIX IPC facilities, BSD IPC facilities
POSIX IPC (shared memory, message queue, semaphore) improves System V IPC
- FIFO (System V) only for local processes communication; Stream Socket (BSD) can communicate over network

## 43.2 Communication Facilities
exchanging data between process

### Data-transfer facilities
One process writes data to IPC facility (user memory to kernel memory) and the other process reads from it (kernel memory to user memory).
![Figure 43-2: Exchanging data between two processes using a pipe](asset/image/fig43-2)

advantage: no synchronization required
disadvantage: slow (from/to kernel), destructive read

#### Byte stream
Pipe, FIFO, stream socket

Read and write arbitrary size of blocks in bytes

UNIX "File as a sequence of bytes" model

#### Message
System V message queue
POSIX message queue
datagram sockets

Read and write by message

#### Pseudoterminals
Provide details in Ch. 64

### Shared memory
![Figure 49-2: Two processes with a shared mapping of the same region of a file](asset/image/fig49-2)

Placing information in a shared memory region. No system calls or transfering between user memory and kernel memory.

advantage: fast, non-destructive read
disadvantage: synchronization required

### Data-transfer vs shared memory
data-transfer: reads are destructive
    MSG_PEEK: non-destructive read
    UDP socket: broadcast, multicast

## 43.3 Synchronization Facilities
synchronizing actions between processes or threads

### Semaphores
- kernel-maintained integer
- will not be smaller than 0
- increase when a process is operating on the shared resource
- blocking: kernel blocks operation until operation being permitted
- non-blocking: immediately returning error if operation not permitted

Binary semaphore: semaphore limited to 0 or 1

### File locks
read(shared) locks
n process to 1 read lock to a file

write(exclusive) locks
Only 1 process can have 1 read lock and 1 write lock

flock()
Simple, lock entire file
rarely used

fcntl()
Lock by file regions



### Signals
CAN be used as communication technique
- signal number is a form of information
- TODO: (realtime signals) realtime signals can have data such an integer or pointer


## 43.4 Comparing IPC Facilities
![Table 43-1: Identifiers and handles for various types of IPC facilities](asset/image/table43-1.png)

Communication
* Data-transfer facilities: byte stream or message-oriented
* System V and POSIX message queues: type: can assign numeric type or priority to rearrange which message being handles first
* Pipes, FIFOs, stream sockets: file descriptors: can use select(), poll(), epoll() to monitor multiple file descriptors to see which I/O is available
* POSIX message queue: provides notification facility, allowing sending signal or instantiate a new thread when message is added to the queue
* UNIX domain sockets: pass file descriptor from one process to another. (Section 61.13.3)
* UDP: sender can broadcast or multicast a message to multiple recipients

Process synchronization
* fcntl(): record lock is owned by the process. kernel will throw error if there is deadlock
* record lock will release automatically when process terminates; System V has "undo" feature but not reliable; POSIX semaphores do not have this feature
* System V and POSIX semaphores don't have ownership property so no deadlock detection

#### Network communication
In Figure 43-1, only sockets permit processes communicate over network
Sockets allow processes on different hosts connected via TCP/IP network.

Convert from UNIX domain socket to Internet domain socket is easy.

#### Portability
POSIX IPC facilities only in Linux 2.6.x kernel series.
System V IPC is more portable.
TODO: confirm

### System V IPC design issues
Complicated programming interface
* No handle(like file descriptor) for an open IPC object so developers need to maintain reference count of the object to know if it can be deleted
* Incompatible with UNIX I/O model: System V IPC uses integer key values and IPC id rather than pathnames and file descriptors.

POSIX IPC improves the above issues.


![Table 43-2: Accessibility and persistence for various types of IPC facilities](asset/image/table43-2.png)
### Accessibility
* permissions mask: FIFO, sockets: file permissions mask
    System V IPC objects: permissions mask similar to file
* related: pipes, anonymous memory mappings; one process creates object and must fork() so child process can access it
* No restrictions on accessing Internet domain socket


### Persistence
* Process persistence
    * at least 1 process holds the IPC object
    * Pipes, FIFOs, sockets
* Kernel persistence
    * explicitly delete IPC object
    * system shuts down
    * System V IPC, POSIX IPC
* File-system persistence
    * explicitly delete IPC object
    * Shared-memory


### Performance
No comparison since
* not significant
* vary across UNIX implementations, versions
* context switch, amount of data, etc.

Abstract IPC facilities from applications to test performance
